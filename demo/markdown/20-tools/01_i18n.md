# Internationnalization

You could easly translate some slides.

-   You just have to create the same file in the same folder using this pattern : `filename.lang.md`.
-   And after, simply add the lang in the url like this : `?data-lang=lang`.
-   Default lang is `EN`.
-   Default language is something you can define when starting the presentation.
