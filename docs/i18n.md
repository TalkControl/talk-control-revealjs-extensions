# I18N your slides

If you want to translate your slides, you simply have to add the extension corresponding to the translate langage : `XX-slide.FR.md`.
The default langage used is English, so by default a file with no extension or when you ask english slides, the engine provides you the markdown files without lang suffix.
If your asking a slide that is not available in the asked langage, the engine will provide you the "default" langage slide.
To resume, asking `EN` langage will serve you default markdown files.

## How to use it ?

If you have provide translation, to specify the langage you want to use, you have two options :

-   define the langage in the index.html
-   adding a parameter specifying the langage

**The file translated have to be the exact translation of all the slides you in the original deck. As we serve a whole file, if there are missing slides in the translate file, there will be no fallback ! **

The suffix of translated file have to be in **uppercase** !

### Configuration in the index.html

```html
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <div class="slides" data-lang="EN">...</div>
    </div>
</body>
```

### Configuration by URL

Simply add a query parameter in the URL `data-lang` with the wanted langage after.

## Changing default langage

If you want to change the default langage, you have to specify to the initializer which language it is:

tcI18nOptions :

```javascript
tcI18nOptions: {
    baseMarkdownPath: 'markdown/',
    defaultLang:'FR'
},
```

-   `baseMarkdownPath` : specify the path to your markdown files (from the '/index.html' baseref).
-   `defaultLang` : Lang in uppercase to use by default

## There are error in my console.

Indeed, if you haven't translate all your files, due to "fallback" mechanism, we check that every ask file exist before serving it. So if you don't translate all your files, it's will display you 404 errors.
